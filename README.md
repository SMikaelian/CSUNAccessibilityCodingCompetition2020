Created a Discord bot that transcribes speech from voice channels to text for hard of hearing users. 
[Created for CSUN Coding Competition 2020]
```

# Objectives of the project:
```
1. Create a bot on Discord and tailor it to our needs.
2. Have the bot follow users in/out of different voice channels.
3. Make the bot listen to different voice channels on a Discord server (Single/Multi-user).
4. Transcribe speech to text using Artificial Intelligence (Speech Recognition).
5. Send the transcribed results in a private message to each user using the service.
6. Self-destruct all messages after 20 seconds of generation for privacy protection.

[All objectives have been achieved successfully.]

## This project utilizes the following resources:
```
- JavaScript.
- Discord API - Discord.js
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
```

# How to use:
```
- Get invited into the Discord server.
- To have the bot listen to you and/or send you transcribed text type: !opt in
- To make the bot stop listening to you and send you transcribed text type: !opt out
(You will be greeted in sign language).
- You can use the "!opt in list" command to see all opt in users.
```

# Help:
```
Type !help in the Discord chat to get bot help commands.
```

# Testing, functionality, and user experience:
```
- The bot's functionality has been fully tested out with a hard of hearing user.
- The user confirmed functionality and results.
- The user was satisfied with the overall experience.
```

# Future Work:
```
- Add Speech to ASL feature.
- Discord/Google overlay.
- Send responses in multiple channels inside the bot.
- Make it accessible for all servers.
- Possibly creating a text log.
- Testing it further in groups with hard of hearing users.
- Reimplement the follow and Voice Channel Join/Leave Notification functions
```
